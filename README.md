# Apple Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
https://web-app-apple-stock-price-prediction-fggaepqxxkine3fsgx8ya3.streamlit.app
This repository showcases my exploration of various machine learning models for predicting Apple's stock prices. It includes a practical implementation and evaluation of six different regression models, ranging from simple to more complex methods.

## Models Explored
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Model
- Support Vector Regressor
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Network

## Best Model: Web App Integration
The most effective model has been integrated into a web application, offering a user-friendly interface for stock price predictions.

## Repository Structure
- `Jupyter Notebooks`: Each model's implementation and evaluation are documented in separate Jupyter notebooks located in Appendix B.
- `Web App Code`: The source code for the web application featuring the best model.

## How to Use
1. Explore the individual notebooks for a detailed view of each model's approach and performance.
2. Check out the web app directory for insights into how the best-performing model was integrated into a real-world application.

## Key Findings
- A comparative analysis of model performances.
- Insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach.
